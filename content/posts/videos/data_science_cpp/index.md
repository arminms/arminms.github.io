This is a series of talks about using modern `C++` for high-performance data science. In the first talk of the series, we talk a little bit about the pros and cons of using `C++` for data science projects and then we cover [Xeus-Cling](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling) and [G3P](https://github.com/arminms/g3p) for rapid-prototyping of `C++` codes and embedding plots and charts in a Jupyter notebook, respectively. The whole series will be available as an [executable book](https://executablebooks.org/) at https://armin.sobhani.me/high-performance-data-science-with-modern-cpp .
