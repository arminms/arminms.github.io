Visual Studio Code (vscode) is a free and open-source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git version control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. It is also extensible and customizable, so users can install extensions to add new languages, themes, debuggers and change the editor’s keyboard shortcuts, and preferences.

In this seminar we focus on one compiled and one scripting language common in advanced research computing projects, namely C/C++ and Python, respectively. We show how to use the same CMake configuration we have developed in the previous talk to edit, version-control, build and debug our C/C++ codebase exactly the same way in vscode on different platforms (only Linux and Windows will be demonstrated). Then we show how to deal effectively with Python codes.

Some knowledge of Git version control system, CMake build system, and Nix package manager is desirable but not mandatory. To that end, reviewing the following previous seminars before attending this one may be helpful:
