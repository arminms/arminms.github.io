Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a free and open-source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git version control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. It is also extensible and customizable, so users can install extensions to add new languages, themes, debuggers and change the editor's keyboard shortcuts, and preferences.

In this webinar we will focus on how to do remote development on HPC clusters effectively. Including but not limited to configuring SSH agent and config file, version controlling with external repositories, providing makefile and CMake support, remote debugging on compute nodes, etc. The materials presented during the live session are available on [SHARCNET GitHub account](https://github.com/sharcnet/vscode-hpc).
