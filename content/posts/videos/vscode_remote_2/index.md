Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a free and open-source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git version control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. In Part I of this seminar we covered configuring SSH agent and config file, version controlling with external repositories, providing makefile and CMake support and remote debugging on compute nodes using the proxy jump method:
