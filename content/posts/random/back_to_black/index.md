Lately, I've been noticing there are more and more black strands among my now almost completely grey hair. I never asked anyone else's opinion about it simply because my impression was that's just my imagination. That all changed yesterday...

Yesterday, in my monthly routine haircut, as soon as my barber who is a very sharp (mentally and instrumentally) Asian lady started to trim my hair, completely to my surprise, asked me if I have noticed my hair is backing to black cause she can tell for sure it is! 😲

I said “As a matter of fact, yes…” but before I could even finish she continued by saying it’s happening to about 10-15 of her regular customers!!! 🤯 She genuinely believed it’s one of the side effects of covid vaccine.

True or false, that’s an interesting observation. Have you had such an experience with your hair color recently?

Whether it’s something that happens to people with certain ethnicity or traits and if it’s gonna last, are among many questions that remained to be answered as the time goes by.
